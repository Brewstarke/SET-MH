Immediate Actions:



Needs:
-Add cast functions to post tables of site and station 'attributes' like number of positions measured etc.


-Fix bug in /graphs/Plotting_Tool doPlot function

-Add the database file path (SET.DB.path) to the report output to allow for tracking that the correct file was pulled in.

-Adapt the munge and ID field creation to accomodate the shallow SETs
  -strategy 1- subset and remove shallow stations to a new dataframe
  -strategy 2- modify the ID field to add one layer on top of the stations

-Need to enter GPS coords in database

Wishes and Ideas:

- Add a warning() message that lets user know if the numbers of levels in Position_ID is  not equal (!==) to Location_ID/4 asking to pick up if there's potentially missing data from a SET arm direction (or other)
